All files are available in `3d_files/`.

All the parts are printed with 20% infill, and I use an Ender 3. I usually have to sand down the edges due to stringing etc.
According to your printer's over/under extrusion you might have to sand down edges, or add silicon tape to the bolt heads so they key into the bodies.
I personally prefer to use a brim.
